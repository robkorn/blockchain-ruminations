#  Ruminations On Decentralizd Systems/Related Topics

This is a backup of sorts for my Urbit notebook: `~mocrux-nomdep/de-centralized-ruminations`

To subscribe to my notebook paste this command into dojo:

```
:publish|subscribe ~mocrux-nomdep %de-centralized-ruminations
```

In short, all the content is made of ideas, concepts, protocols, or whatever else I come up with related to blockchain + distributed/decentralized systems that I consider worth sharing.

You can take a gander here on github as well, and easily share it, but I would recommend subscribing directly with your Urbit ship for the best experience.
