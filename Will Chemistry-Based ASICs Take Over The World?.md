Will Chemistry-Based ASICs Take Over The World?
==============================

Here I was presenting in the Miami Beach Convention center in the middle of April 2019 at a blockchain conference in front of an attentive audience, and yet the whole time a seemingly random question was stuck in the back of my mind. "Has anyone attempted to map/define the algorithms behind chemical reactions?"

Odd question I'm sure you'd agree, but it occurred to me that since chemistry is inherently a hard/reproducible science (the reactions within chemistry have predictable outcomes), there inherently must be algorithms that are encoded within the natural order that cause said outcomes to occur. Given that is the case, shouldn't there theoretically be chemical reactions with underlying algorithms which map onto problems we face in computing? 

In some sense, can we use the innate relations/characteristics of matter at the chemical level to compute problems more efficiently? To your computer science nerd (me) it appears that at the chemical level nature seems to have a naturally occurring form of an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) built right in where if you supply given ratios of inputs, you get a predictable output. 

By codifying the input chemicals into some sort of encoding, and then doing the same thing for the resulting outputs, it should theoretically start to be possible to map out just what these reactions are doing at a data level/point of view rather than a chemical/physical one. Thus if we come to discover a certain reaction runs a certain algorithm, it should be possible to carefully craft a batch of input chemistry (which encodes to input you wish to compute with) and then "run the function/algorithm" (put all the chemicals together), and be left with the results in short time.

With that said we can now get to the question that interests me most about this whole train of thought. "Could these innate chemical reactions be somehow embedded in reality in such a way that they are more efficient at computation than anything we as mere humans can manually encode ourselves?"

Another way to understand that question for the more technical among us is essentially asking if chemical reactions could be functions with algorithms that seem to be running according to a runtime exogenous to our system (the universe we live in) and as we are stuck within our VM/runtime that is inherently slower, can we never actually encode the exact same algorithm with the exact same efficiency as what exists within nature itself?

I ended up doing a slight bit of research into all of this shortly after, but I mostly came across papers/work ([such as this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4221813/)) which tend to look more at using chemistry to perform arbitrary computations (and show they can be turing complete) rather than mapping all of the algorithms underneath chemical reactions themselves (at least from what I gathered in my skimming).

Whether using chemical-based algorithms for actual computing make any sense at all (assuming my presupposition that they are faster is true) will likely have to come down to the costs associated with setting up the initial state (including all environmental variables), the dangers of potential resulting chemicals/safe disposal of such, and the accurate reading of the resulting output so that it could be encoded and understood.

As such, even if there are problems which could be solved orders of magnitude more efficiently using chemistry, maybe the truth is that we humans are simply far too ill-equipped to play God in our attempt to manipulate existence itself to set up the perfect initial state which allows for chemical computation to run without a hitch.

Thus as we come to a close, will chemistry-based ASICs take over the world by one day by jumping past quantum computing and break all of the world's cryptography thanks to every middle schooler's favorite subdivision of science? Unlikely, but it sure was a fun thought experiment at the very least.

If anyone has any more actual knowledge/understanding of all this (compared to my haphazardly speculative approach mixed with a plethora of naivety in the subject area) I'd be happy to hear from you.
